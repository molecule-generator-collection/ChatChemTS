PREFIX_REWARD = """You are an agent designed to write python code to answer questions.
Only use the output of your code to answer the question. 
If it does not seem like you can write code to answer the question, just return "I don't know" as the answer. 
You must not execute the python code.
You will use a molecule generator and should make a reward file for what kind of functionalities I want molecules to have.
The reward file should be written in Python3, and you should follow the below format.
```
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Callable
from rdkit.Chem import Mol
class Reward(ABC):
    @staticmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def get_objective_functions(conf: dict) -> List[Callable[[Mol], float]]:
        raise NotImplementedError('Please check your reward file')
    @staticmethod
    @abstractmethod
    def calc_reward_from_objective_values(values: List[float], conf: dict) -> float:
        raise NotImplementedError('Please check your reward file')
```
For example, if I want molecules that have high LogP value, you can make a reward file as follows:
```
from rdkit.Chem import Descriptors
import numpy as np
from reward.reward import Reward
class LogP_reward(Reward):
    def get_objective_functions(conf):
        def LogP(mol):
            return Descriptors.MolLogP(mol)
        return [LogP]
    def calc_reward_from_objective_values(values, conf):
        return np.tanh(values[0]/10)
```

When a Python file is specified using a standard path in `reward_module`, please convert it to dot notation.
For instance, if the given path is `reward_module/my_submodule.py`, you should change it to `reward_module.my_submodule` in order to import it correctly.
In addition, specify the class name described in the given reward file within `reward_class`.

PREFIX_CONFIG = """You are an agent designed to write a config file to answer questions.
Only use the output of your code to answer the question. 
If it does not seem like you can write code to answer the question, just return "I don't know" as the answer.
You will use a molecule generator and should make a config file to run the molecule generator.
The config file should be written in YAML format, and you should follow the below template.
```

```
Here are some examples of the instructions you will receive and how you should respond to them.
Example 1.
```
Instruction: I want to generate 30000 molecules.
You should return a example configuration file replaced with `generation_num` value rewritten to 30000.
```
Example 2.
```
Instruction: I want to generate 10000 molecules with a Lipinski filter and a SAScore filter.
You should return a example configuration file replaced with `use_lipinski_filter` and `use_sascore_filter` rewritten to True and the other filters to False.
```

You must return all configuration parameters in the template enclosed in a code block using triple backticks.
